    <h4>A note on major employability:</h4>
      <ul>Just because your major of choice has a lower unemployment rate doesn't
      necessarily mean you should change majors. You may just want to be more proactive about securing summer internships
      and building an impressive resume that has more than just good grades.</ul>

      <h4>What are the most important considerations when deciding on a major?</h4>
        <ul>Think of your major as a stepping stone towards what you ultimately want to do for a living. If you need to make a tradeoff
          between loving your major and loving your future career, it makes more sense to favor the latter. Besides this, look at the student
          faculty ratios in the department to see how much individual attention you will get a student. Try to get a snese of the atmosphere
          of the department and see if you are interested in the research of any of the professors.</ul>
